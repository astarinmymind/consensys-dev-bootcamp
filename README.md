# Consensys Blockchain Developer Bootcamp 2020

## Coding my own Blockchain from Scratch in Python3 - blockchain.py

- implemented a simple Proof of Work algorithm similar to HashCash
- used Python Flask to communicate with blockchain through http requests
- used Postman to interact with blockchain (create new transaction, mine new block, return full blockchain)
- implemented consensus algorithm by checking chains in other nodes and finding the longest valid chain

## Generating Ethereum Accounts in Javascript
- Learning public key cryptography and digital signatures. 
- Generate a private key, derive public keys from the private key and determine the associated accounts.

## Using Geth (Go-Ethereum)
- Geth (Go-Ethereum) is a command line interface for running a full ethereum node implemented inGo. 
- Geth is used to mine real ether, transfer funds between addresses, create contracts and send transactions, and explore block history.
- Played around with geth javascript console ($ geth console)
- Created private blockchain (genesis.json)
